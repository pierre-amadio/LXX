"""
Somes books have funny sort order of chapters, or verses within a chapter.
By example:

Proverbs ends up with several nodes for the same chapter in this order 24,30,24,30.
Jeremiah 10 has the following verse order: 1,2,3,4,9,5

Some frontends such as Xiphos are confused when a text has missing verses, which happens.
To workaround this, non existing verses are creating containing just [â€¦].
Having chapter or verses not sorted correctly makes this process complicated.
This script takes a xml book and turn it into a well sorted book.
