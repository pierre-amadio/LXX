* deal with 36.Sirach.imp prolog as a milestone                                                                                                                                                               
those 36 verses are supposed to be milestone _before_ verse1.
 <milestone type="x-alt-v11n" n="1"/>
right now, those are set as milestones in verses Sir1:0
should they be under the chapter directly ?

*  how to deal with title such as 55.EpJer.imp 37.PsSol.imp 30.Odes.imp 56.Lam.imp 61.DanielOG.imp
# 55 EpJer   1 chapter, title for both book and chapter...
# 37 PsSol  psalm title... i wonder if they are supposed to be considered are belonging to verse 1
# DONE 30 Odes http://www.textexcavation.com/lxxodes.html seems to be also chapter titles.
# 56 Lam , several chapters, seems to be a book title.
# DONE 61 DanielOG chapter 5 only. 

* what is actually valid in a lemma as far as lex is concerned ?
TODO: gen 1.7 
<w lemma="χωρίζω, δια" morph="packard:VAI AAI3S" xlit="betacode:DIEXW/RISEN">διεχώρισεν</w>
should there be lex entry ? if so, one or two ?
in previous osis:
<w lemma="strong:G0,G0 lex:χωρίζω,δια" morph="packard:VAI+AAI3S" xlit="betacode:DIEXW/RISEN">διεχώρισεν</w>

* I m not sure the bin/5-specific-combine-subtype.py script works on all case.
What if the order of the book is wrong, some final chapter may be missing.
Double check that !

#Excerpt from "Septuaginta, a reader's edition", p334:
#some witnesses to the greek version of proverbs contain portion of chs 30-31 inserted within ch24 as reflected in rahlfs-hannhart.
#the reason for this textual divergence remains unclear and we have retained teh versifications of the masoretic text for simplicity.
#I think this is what cyrille's script is doing too when it change chp 32-36 to 25-29 here:
#Correction du chapitrage dans Prov
#sed -ri 's/(\$\$\$Prov\/)32(\/)/\125\2/g' 002.txt
#sed -ri 's/(\$\$\$Prov\/)33(\/)/\126\2/g' 002.txt
#sed -ri 's/(\$\$\$Prov\/)34(\/)/\127\2/g' 002.txt
#sed -ri 's/(\$\$\$Prov\/)35(\/)/\128\2/g' 002.txt
