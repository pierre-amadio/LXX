When there are concatenated verses for text with two variants, as in Daniel 4:37
the variant concatenated verses appears in both variants.
The ./bin/9-marking-concatenated-verses.sh script should occurs before ./bin/7-specificStuff.sh
in order to fix that.

* what is actually valid in a lemma as far as lex is concerned ?
TODO: gen 1.7 
<w lemma="χωρίζω, δια" morph="packard:VAI AAI3S" xlit="betacode:DIEXW/RISEN">διεχώρισεν</w>
should there be lex entry ? if so, one or two ?
in previous osis:
<w lemma="strong:G0,G0 lex:χωρίζω,δια" morph="packard:VAI+AAI3S" xlit="betacode:DIEXW/RISEN">διεχώρισεν</w>
